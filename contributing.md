## Adding a New Use Case

If you're adding a completely new use case that doesn't fit into the existing categories, follow these steps:

1. **Find the right domain**
   If it fits into an existing category, place it under the right domain section in **README.md**.

2. **Create a new section**
   If it's a completely new use case and domain, add a new section at the bottom of the **README.md**.
