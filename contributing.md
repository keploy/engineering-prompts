## Guidelines

- **Be Clear:** Your prompt should have enough context that anyone can understand what it's asking.
- **Be Concise:** Keep prompts short and on-topicâ€”avoid redundant phrasing.
- **Be Descriptive:** Include meaningful, domain-specific instructions so the AI can provide precise output.
- **Be Respectful:** Keep communication positive and constructive during code review and discussion.

## Adding a New Use Case or Domain

If you're adding a completely new use case or domain:

1. **Find the Right Domain (if possible):**
   If your prompt logically fits into an existing domain, add it under the correct section in **README.md**.

2. **Create a New Domain Section:**
   If your use case doesnâ€™t fit any existing domain, add a new top-level domain section at the bottom of the **README.md**, following the structure of other sections.
