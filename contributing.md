## How to Contribute

   Create a new branch for your contribution, such as `feature/your-feature-name`.

   Navigate to the appropriate section in **README.md** based on the domain your prompt belongs to. If your prompt doesn't fit into any of the existing sections, feel free to create a new one under the corresponding category.

4. **Update the README:**
   Provide a clear description for your prompt chain. Use the format:

   ```
   ### **{Domain Name}**

   - **{Use Case Name}**  
     "{Prompt Chain}"
   ```

5. **Test Your Changes:**

## Guidelines

## Adding a New Use Case or Domain

#### If it fits into an existing domain:
1. Navigate to the appropriate domain folder inside the `domains/` directory.
2. Open its `README.md`.
3. Add your new use case as a bullet point or sub-section in that file.
4. Follow the existing formatting for consistency.

#### If it's a completely new domain:
1. Inside the `domains/` directory, create a new folder with a meaningful name (e.g., `mobile-development`).
2. Inside that folder, create a `README.md` file.
3. Add your use cases and prompts inside this new `README.md`.
4. At the bottom of the main `README.md` (root level), add a new entry to the Table of Contents linking to your new domain:

```md
  [Mobile Development](domains/mobile-development/README.md)
```
