# Generative AI Interview Prompts

## Prompt 1: RAG Pipeline Design

Design a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can query a companyâ€™s internal documentation (PDFs, Notion, internal wiki) to generate real-time customer responses.

## Prompt 2: LLM Evaluation Metrics

You are tasked with evaluating three LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude). Define objective metrics and testing strategies for accuracy, hallucination, and latency in a QA chatbot.

## Prompt 3: Prompt Injection Mitigation

Explain how prompt injection attacks work. Propose a defense mechanism to secure your GenAI app used by thousands of users daily.

## Prompt 4: Fine-Tuning vs RAG

Compare and contrast fine-tuning an LLM with using a RAG system. In what scenarios would one be preferred over the other?

## Prompt 5: Multimodal GenAI Product Design

Design a GenAI tool that accepts images and voice inputs from doctors and generates medical notes. What models, pipelines, and data formats would you use?
