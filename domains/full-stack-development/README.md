# **5. Full-Stack Development**

* **Develop a Full-Stack Web Application Using Django and React**

  ```text
  "Create a full-stack web application with Django as the backend and React for the frontend. Implement user authentication, RESTful API communication, and a simple CRUD interface. Return the project structure and code snippets."
  ```

* **Integrate a Payment Gateway (Stripe) in a Full-Stack App**

  ```text
  "Integrate Stripe for handling payments in a full-stack application with Django and React. Set up the backend to handle payments and the frontend to interact with Stripe's API. Return the code for integration."
  ```

* **Create a RESTful API with Express.js**

  ```text
  "Help me set up a RESTful API using Express.js. Define the necessary routes and controllers to support CRUD operations for a {resource}. Return the implementation of the API with explanations for each endpoint."
  ```

* **Implement Real-Time Updates with WebSockets**

  ```text
  "Set up real-time updates in the application using WebSockets. Provide the necessary code for both the server (using socket.io or similar) and the frontend to enable live updates."
  ```

* **Test Backend and Frontend for Regression Using Keploy**

  ```text
  "Set up Keploy in your full-stack application to test both the backend and frontend after an update. Configure Keploy for automatic integration testing, focusing on testing API endpoints, data handling, and the interaction between the frontend and backend. Ensure that Keploy is set to capture all changes in the API response, including edge cases, and validate that the frontend works correctly with the updated backend. Return the setup configuration and steps to trigger Keploy for testing."
  ```

* **Modular Full-Stack Application**

  ```text
  "Build a full-stack application with a frontend using {frontend_framework} and a backend using {backend_framework}. Implement routing, state management, authentication, and persistent data storage with {database_technology}. Ensure modularity and scalability."
  ```

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

  ```text
  "Implement role-based access control across frontend and backend using {auth_method}. Protect frontend routes and backend endpoints based on roles like {roles_list}."
  ```

* **Reusable Component & Service Structure**

  ```text
  "Design reusable UI components using {ui_library} and reusable backend service logic using {architecture_pattern}. Ensure separation of concerns and maintain clean code structure."
  ```

* **Form Submission Flow**

  ```text
  "Create a form using {form_library} on the frontend and connect it to backend endpoints built with {server_framework}. Include validation, success/error feedback, and secure data handling."
  ```

* **End-to-End Error Handling**

  ```text
  "Implement global error handling across the full stack. Catch, log, and display errors from both the frontend and backend using {error_tracking_tool}, and show user-friendly messages on the UI."
  ```

* **Real-Time Data Sync**

  ```text
  "Integrate real-time features using {realtime_tech} for full-duplex communication between clients and server. Use this to implement live updates for {use_case}, including proper state syncing."
  ```

* **File Upload and Storage Pipeline**

  ```text
  "Implement file upload from the frontend using {upload_library} and process/store the files on the backend using {storage_service}. Include file validation, error handling, and upload progress tracking."
  ```

* **Authentication and Protected Routes**

  ```text
  "Create full-stack authentication using {auth_library}. Implement protected routes on frontend and backend, and use token/session-based authentication. Secure sensitive endpoints and user sessions."
  ```

* **Analytics Dashboard with Visualization**

  ```text
  "Build a dashboard that fetches data via APIs built in {backend_framework} and visualizes them using {chart_library}. Include filters, real-time updates, and drill-down analytics."
  ```

* **Paginated & Infinite Scrolling Lists**

  ```text
  "Implement frontend pagination or infinite scroll using {pagination_strategy}, supported by backend pagination logic using {query_method}. Optimize API performance and user experience."
  ```
