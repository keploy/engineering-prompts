# Explain a Sorting Algorithm with Code (LLM Prompt)

## Objective:
Use a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT or DeepSeek to explain a sorting algorithm step-by-step, with a code example in Python.

---

## Prompt:
> “Explain how the Merge Sort algorithm works, step-by-step. Include a Python code implementation. Then describe the time and space complexity in simple terms. Finally, provide one use case where Merge Sort is better than Quick Sort.”

---

## Expected LLM Response Structure:
1. **Algorithm Explanation** – What it does and how it works
2. **Code Implementation** – Merge Sort in Python (with comments)
3. **Complexity Analysis** – Time and Space complexity
4. **Use Case Example** – When and why to prefer Merge Sort

---

## Test Scenario:
Try this prompt on ChatGPT-4, DeepSeek, or Ollama with LLaMA3 and verify if the response includes all expected parts.

---

## Use Case:
This LLM prompt helps software engineers or students quickly understand and visualize a commonly asked algorithmic topic like Merge Sort, backed by both theory and implementation.
