#  Engineering Prompts

Welcome to the **Engineering Prompts** repository! This repository contains a collection of AI prompt chains organized by different domains, primarily for assisting developers in various tasks such as code refactoring, CI/CD setup, database management, cloud, Kubernetes deployment, web development, API Development, security, and more.

Each prompt chain is designed to build context for ChatGPT before executing a task. They can be used in ChatGPT Queue for bulk prompting, job, or task-focused automation.

Each domain has its own set of prompts in separate folders. Click any domain below to explore.
